# Rafiki Virtual Assistant
**Rafiki** is a Hampton University specific voice and virtual assistant
##
The primary objective of the Rafiki Bot is to satisfy the needs of any user who has follow up questions about Hampton University. The completed product will allow for users to generate responses for frequently asked questions, location assistance, and departmental inquiries. 

Given that Rafiki exists to guide users with some relation to Hampton University, we chose to integrate our bot with the Hampton University website directly. By using a live instance of HU's webpage, and a minified interface for our bot, we managed to create example endpoints for what the final integration of our bot into Hampton's main-page will be. Rafiki exists in the bottom corner of the webpage.
